TODO:
=========
- rework how newly opened buffer get the remarks updated
- cleanup inline defined function for automcds, like GoTestLineDiag
- function for getting test key from "buffer test"
- user aurgroup in all relevant autocmds
- remove the copying of package info to the buffers table, it can be searched when needed
- move package cache to state as "packages"
- on test file buffer save, how to transfer test marks ids


- emplement verbose logging than can be enabled/disabled
- close the debug window when user leaves it
- maybe i can load all package info on start and don't do it on buf-open, only if the information is missing
- if the package info is available before test are searched in file, they can be indexed by the "key"
